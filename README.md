# Portfolio Project

This is a portfolio website where I will showcase my projects I have been working on,
and the skills I have acquired. 
I used React + Vite, a component library called react bits
(this is where the silk.jsx, glassicons.jsx, and SpotlightCard.jsx components come from.),
I also used Tailwindcss for my styling.

Thanks for taking the time to look at my code! 😃🧙🏻‍♂️
